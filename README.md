# Diffmint

Diffmint is a local-first, policy-driven code review product.

- Primary experience: CLI and VS Code extension
- Web role: control plane for workspaces, providers, Polar billing, policies, history, audit, and docs
- Package manager: `pnpm`
- Production domain: [diffmint.io](https://diffmint.io)
- Local dev stack: `Docker Compose` with hot reload and Postgres

## Product surfaces

### CLI

Implemented command surface:

- `dm auth login`
- `dm auth logout`
- `dm config set-provider`
- `dm review`
- `dm explain`
- `dm tests`
- `dm history`
- `dm doctor`

Current status:

- command UX works
- device auth now includes browser approval, and bootstrap/history sync use approved client sessions
- local scaffold review works with offline fallback
- review commands now switch to Qwen headless mode automatically when a local `qwen` binary and
  compatible provider credentials are available
- offline sync queue preserves review uploads until the control plane is reachable again
- history is stored locally and can sync to the web control plane
- scaffold mode remains available through `DIFFMINT_REVIEW_RUNTIME=scaffold` for deterministic local
  runs and CI

### VS Code extension

Implemented command surface:

- Review Current Changes
- Review Staged Changes
- Review Selected Files
- Explain Current File
- Generate Tests
- Open History
- Open Team Rules
- Sign In

Current status:

- extension builds
- commands invoke the CLI
- production packaging and deeper IDE polish are still pending

### Web control plane

Active routes:

- `/dashboard/overview`
- `/dashboard/workspaces`
- `/dashboard/workspaces/team`
- `/dashboard/providers`
- `/dashboard/policies`
- `/dashboard/history`
- `/dashboard/audit`
- `/dashboard/billing`
- `/dashboard/docs`
- `/docs/[...slug]`
- `/install`

Removed starter/demo routes:

- products
- users
- chat
- notifications
- forms
- kanban
- react-query demo
- exclusive page
- starter overview charts

## Billing

Billing is now oriented around `Polar`.

Implemented billing pieces:

- Polar environment/config helpers
- Polar checkout route: `/api/polar/checkout`
- Polar customer portal route: `/api/polar/portal`
- Polar webhook route: `/api/polar/webhooks`
- Polar-backed billing control-plane page
- Admin doc: `/docs/admin/billing-with-polar`

Important:

- auth and workspace management still use Clerk
- billing and subscriptions use Polar
- billing state is wired into the shared control-plane service and persisted when `DATABASE_URL` is set
- Polar webhooks now update the billing snapshot and audit trail; signature validation and richer reconciliation remain to be hardened

## Getting started

### Local

```bash
pnpm install
cp apps/web/env.example.txt apps/web/.env.local
pnpm dev
```

If you want Postgres-backed control-plane state outside Docker, set `DATABASE_URL` and then run:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

For production-like environments, also set `DIFFMINT_REQUIRE_PERSISTENCE=true` so the control plane
fails fast when Postgres is unavailable instead of silently falling back to in-memory state.

### Docker

```bash
pnpm docker:dev
pnpm docker:dev:logs
pnpm docker:dev:down
pnpm docker:dev:reset
```

The Docker stack starts:

- Next.js web app on `http://localhost:3000`
- Postgres on `localhost:5432`
- migrations and seed data before the web server boots

Production builds use webpack for stability. Development keeps the normal `next dev` workflow for hot reload.

Runtime probes:

- live: `/api/health/live`
- ready: `/api/health/ready`

The Docker dev stack and production image now use the readiness endpoint for health checks.

## Environment

Core variables live in [apps/web/env.example.txt](/Users/bon/Documents/my-workspace/next-shadcn-dashboard-starter/apps/web/env.example.txt).

Main groups:

- Clerk auth: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- Clerk local smoke override: `DIFFMINT_DISABLE_CLERK`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DIFFMINT_DISABLE_CLERK`
- Postgres: `DATABASE_URL`
- strict persistence mode: `DIFFMINT_REQUIRE_PERSISTENCE`
- Polar billing: `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `POLAR_PRODUCT_ID_*`, `POLAR_SERVER`
- App URL: `DIFFMINT_APP_URL`
- release signing: `DIFFMINT_RELEASE_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, `DIFFMINT_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY_ID`
- web security hardening: `DIFFMINT_ENABLE_HSTS`
- Sentry: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ORG`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_PROJECT`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`

Sentry is optional. Runtime monitoring only turns on when a DSN is configured, and the build plugin
only turns on when the DSN, org, project, and auth token are all present.

The web app now emits baseline security headers for pages and APIs, including `X-Frame-Options`,
`Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy`. `Strict-Transport-Security` is enabled in production
and can be forced on with `DIFFMINT_ENABLE_HSTS=true`.

When Sentry runtime monitoring is off, the web build now aliases Sentry imports to a no-op runtime
to avoid unnecessary OpenTelemetry build noise and keep local production smoke runs cleaner.

For local production smoke tests, you can force public-mode auth behavior even if your machine has
Clerk keys in `apps/web/.env`:

```bash
DIFFMINT_DISABLE_CLERK=true NEXT_PUBLIC_DIFFMINT_DISABLE_CLERK=true pnpm start:web
```

The public release manifest endpoint can also sign CLI and VS Code release metadata when
`DIFFMINT_RELEASE_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is set. Signed manifests include a stable `signature`
envelope with `algorithm`, `keyId`, `signedAt`, and `value`, which keeps updater and release
channel clients on a verifiable contract without changing the endpoint shape.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:e2e:install
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test
pnpm check
```

What is covered now:

- docs-content loaders and navigation
- review-core request/session logic
- review-core runtime switching between scaffold mode and Qwen headless execution
- CLI login/provider/review/history flows
- control-plane service lifecycle for device auth, synced history, usage, and audit events
- approved client-session checks for bootstrap, policies, history, and usage routes
- dashboard access rules for authenticated and workspace-scoped pages
- Polar route guardrails and billing helpers
- public docs/install smoke flows
- client bootstrap API smoke

## Docs

Canonical docs live in `packages/docs-content/content`.

Key pages:

- `/docs/getting-started/5-minute-quickstart`
- `/docs/getting-started/docker-development`
- `/docs/admin/workspace-setup`
- `/docs/admin/billing-with-polar`
- `/docs/security/privacy-and-redaction`

## Current reality

This repo now looks like Diffmint instead of the original dashboard starter, but a few production-critical systems are still being hardened:

- advanced billing reconciliation beyond the current webhook snapshot updates
- extension packaging/release flow

The foundation, cleanup, docs, Docker flow, persistence-aware control plane, test harness, and
Polar billing direction are in place.
